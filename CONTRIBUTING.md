# Not working directly with the data

Don't know how to use MongoDB? Just don't want to? That's ok! You can [submit an issue](https://github.com/dospunk/politinfluence_data/issues/new) with `[DATA]` in the title and your suggested change in the body. If you're submitting a suggested change to an entitiy's stances on issues, please include a source or at the very least an explanation for your reasoning.

# Working directly with the data

Please use the [add tools](https://github.com/dospunk/politinfluence/tree/master/add_data) from [Politinfluence](https://github.com/dospunk/politinfluence) to contrubute to the data, as they have certain functions built in to avoid inconsistancies in the data (such as automatically adding to or updating people's donations). 

When working with the data, please follow the [Style Guide](https://github.com/dospunk/politinfluence/blob/master/DBStyleGuide.md)

To export the data, please use MongoDump
