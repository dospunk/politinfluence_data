# Official Issue Names And Examples Of Positions

This document is to provide a standard naming system for issues and positions. Since this is an opensource project that many people with different beliefs can contribute to, this document should clear up any confusion about what counts as `pro` or `anti`. It should also help to avoid multiple names for the same issue. 

## pro, ppro, anti, and panti

`pro` and `anti` should be self explanatory. `ppro` and `panti` mean presumably pro and presumably anti. Use these when an entity has not given an official statement on an issue, but their position can be somewhat reasonably assumed. For example, a company that sells guns may not have an official statement on gun gontrol, but it can be assumed that they would be against harsher regulations on gun ownership because it would hurt their business. They would be considered presumably anti. A large marketing firm may be considered presumably pro big business because harsher regulations on big business would hurt their consumer base and therefore hurt their profits. 

When labling entitiies, follow the rule of labling sparsly but using `ppro` and `panti` liberally. This means be cautious in labling an entity, but when you do, do not label them as definitely pro/anti unless they have a clear, _stated_ stance.
